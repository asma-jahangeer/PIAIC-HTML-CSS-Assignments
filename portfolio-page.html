        <strong>Why it's special:</strong> Robby incorporates an interactive experience

         <strong>What it's about:</strong> If you associate Portfolio with a dry list of facts, this
         Portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a novel way ofdisplaying what was otherwise 
         dry information &HorizontalLine; he laid out his Portfoliosite as a videogame that the visitors can 
         actually play. This incredibly fun interactive design Portfolio will make
