        <h1>Cloud Native Computing:</h1>
        <p id="cnc">The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program
        in open source techonologies like, <strong><em>Linux, 
            Kubernetes, Javascript, Node,js, React and React Native
        </em></strong> while introducing the students to development of 
    Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS. </p>
    <h1>Artificial Intelligence:</h1>
    <p id="ai">
        The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program takes the students through 
        the foundation of AI technology, via teaching programming
        in open source languages like <strong><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0
            and Flask, 
        </em></strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with
        real-life examples of modren day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h1>Blockchain:</h1>
    <p id="bcc">
        The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like
        <strong><em>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</em></strong> and learn to program in langugaes 
        such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps  (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle
        and an in-depth undrstnding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS)
        and how to develop and offer an Intial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h1>Internet of Things:</h1>
<p id="iot">The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source 
development technologies like <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, 
    Hyper, Diesel, Google Assiistant, and Kubernetes
</em></strong> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IOT 
Edge , IOT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
